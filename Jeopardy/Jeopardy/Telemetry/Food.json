        "difficulty": 3,
        "explanation": "In Korea, after a birth, the mother has to stay warm (no cold shower, no cold water). In addition, seaweed is rich in calcium and iodine, which is beneficial for the mothers who are weak. It has been proven that it does great help on contractions, obesity and constipation, all of whom happen at the end of a pregnancy. Since it is the first meal of the baby (through the mother) and since the mother has eaten a lot of seaweed soup, the child eats the homemade soup of the mother to thank her for giving birth."
