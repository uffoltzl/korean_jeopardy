        "alreadyAnswered": false,
        "difficulty": 3,
        "explanation": "This is the alphabet created by the king Sejong in 1443. He ruled during a period of prosperity, therefore he had the courage to oppose the Chinese. Indeed, the Chinese characters were used to transcribe the korean language. However, only the high society was learning those. As a result, King Sejong wanted an easy enough writing system so that everybody could learn it. The legend says that somebody clever would learn it in 3 hours and somebody who has some difficulties in 3 days. In fact, the system was not spread at the time it was created. Scholars were not willing to give up on the chinese characters, a symbol of their knowledge and status. As a result, Hangeul was banned in 1504. The late 16th century saw a revival of the korean alphabet. It became a symbol of nationalism. It even became a symbol of resistance while being banned during the Japanese occupation. "

        "alreadyAnswered": false,
        "difficulty": 3,
        "explanation": "Although, dog (gae), used as its own, is not an offensive word, once it is used to describe a human, it becomes a string curse word. Some examples would be: gaesaekki, literal meaning dog's offspring, in english son of a bitch - gaesuli, literal meaning dog's sounds, in english bullshit. The insult's origin takes place during the Korean War where opponents compared each other to animals. Thus, being compared to a dog is really offensive in Korean culture. "
