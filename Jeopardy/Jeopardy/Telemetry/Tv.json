In fact, many tourists come to Korea because they have been subject to Hallyu before. "

        "alreadyAnswered": false,
        "difficulty": 2,
        "explanation": "Korea Communications Standards Commission has defined different categories such as violence (weapons) and harmful information to youth (cigarettes, tatoos, sometimes Japanese names and content). When one of those categories is displayed on camera, the rating of the TV show skyrockets which does not allow the production to be aired at regular hours (only at night time). As a result, producers prefer to blur what is offensive. All weapons used to threaten or hurt somebody fall under the category of violence except old weapons, such as swords. In addition injuries with a lot of blood coming out can be blurred as well. "
