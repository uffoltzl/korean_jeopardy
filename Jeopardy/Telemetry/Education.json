        "explanation": "Park Chung Hee became President in 1963. Little by little, he established a dictature: he boosted the economy of the country thanks to his plan, but those decisions were at the cost of Korean's mental and physical health.

Today, academical success is still a synonym to a good socioeconomic position in South Korean society."
